  <p>Long story short, grew up <a href="#" id="siblings">youngest of six</a> obsessed with <a href="#" id="music">music,</a> <a href="#" id="color" >primary colours</a> and <a href="#" id="sugar" >sugar</a>. Did the school thing, went to college and got a BTEC in photography. Chased a girl to Bristol and studied Media Practice, discovered Flash, lost the girl.</p>
  <p>In my final year teamed up with <a href="#" id="dan" >this guy</a> and blagged loads of equipment from <a href="#" id="musion" >Musion Systems</a> to make a 3D holographic adaptation of Hamlet. Alongside this I <a href="#" id="multitouch" >hand built</a> my own multi-touch surface after getting very over-excited by <a href="#" id="jeffhan" >this video.</a></p>
  <p>I graduated with a first and the Roger Cranshaw Memorial Prize 2008, for "work that exhibits qualities of imagination and originality and is the least confined to authority". After university I received an artist residency at the <a href="#" id="pmstudio" >Pervasive Media Studio</a> in Bristol. Here I researched into data harvesting and worked with <a href="#" id="helen" >Helen</a> and we made <a href="#" id="wish" >emotion collecting web bots.</a></p>
  <p>For three years I have freelanced around the UK in London, Bristol, and Manchester. Highlights include making mobile games for <a href="#" id="mobilepie" >this lot,</a> writing <a href="#" id="mappingtoolkit" >this</a> application for <a href="#" id="antivjimg" >AntiVJ</a> which allows them to do amazing building projections <a href="#" id="antivj" >like this,</a> teaching Flash to students at <a href="#" id="uwe" >Bristol UWE,</a> wiring up <a href="#" id="cornelius" >Cornelius,</a> an Arduino controlled robot for <a href="#" id="sustrans" >Sustrans</a> and doing an eighteen month stint at <a href="#" id="aardman" >Aardman Animations</a> creating <a href="#" id="bafta" >Bafta</a> award winning games and websites.</p>
  <p>Outside of work I like to spend every free moment getting filthy, <a href="#" id="bikes" >riding my rides.</a> Any time left over I waste <a href="#" id="bestival" >partying hard.</a> These last years have been amazing for me, make the coming year even better, <a href="/contact.php" id="hireme" >hire me.</a></p>
